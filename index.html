            <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My time in the Computer Science program has changed how I approach software development. I started out focused on writing code that worked, but I have learned to now think about the complete solution, and the people who will use it. The coursework gave the foundation, but the real learning came from working on projects where I had to turn requirements into functioning applications.</p>

                <p>Through various assignments and projects at SNHU, I've learned how to communicate technical decisions and ensure different components work together properly. Collaborating on group projects taught me how to merge different coding styles and problem solving approaches into working applications. This also applies to working with stakeholders, where understanding what users need matters more than just hitting technical specs.</p>

                <p>I've also built-up solid skills across the stack through my courses. Such as data structures and algorithms for implementing efficient operations, software engineering principles for building modular systems, and database design with proper schema structure and indexing. Security is also something I consider from the beginning now. Authentication, input validation, these kinds of things need to be a part of the initial design.</p>

                <p>The work in this portfolio demonstrates these skills. I chose to enhance a project from a previous class: Travlr Getaways. These enhancements show how I can take an existing codebase and improve it across multiple areas: mobile development, algorithm optimization, database structure. Each enhancement connects to the others, showing how different CS concepts come together in real life applications.</p>
